 British personnel British Parliament, Prime Minister Tony Blair stated that the film was an "affront" to British Royal Navy|sailors. 

The real   was never involved in any such events, was not captured, and was in fact sunk in January 1944, off Ireland, by a Short Sunderland flying boat from No. 461 Squadron RAAF|No. 461 Squadron, Royal Australian Air Force.

==Plot==
German U-boat U-571 is immobilized by a British destroyer. The US Navy submarine S-33 has been modified to resemble a German U-boat to steal the Enigma coding device and sink the U-571. 

During a storm, the S-33 comes across U-571 and sends a boarding party over. After securing the ship and transporting the captured crew back to the American S-33 sub, the S-33 gets sunk by the arrival of a German resupply sub. The captain of the S-33, Lieutenant Commander Dahlgren, dying in the water, orders his men on the captured U-boat to submerge. Lieutenant Tyler takes command of the enemy U-boat and dives to engage the resupply sub in an underwater battle before destroying it. 

After making repairs and restoring power Tyler decides to route the disabled submarine to Lands End in Cornwall, England. They are spotted by a German plane which is unaware that the U-571 has been commandeered by Americans; a nearby German destroyer sends over a small contingent but right before boarders arrive, Tyler gives orders to fire a shot from the deck gun, destroying the German ships radio room, and preventing it from reporting that the capture of a German sub and its Enigma machine and code books. The sub dives underneath the German ship, which then begins to drop depth charges to sink U-571.

Tyler attempts to trick the destroyer into stopping its attack by ejecting debris and a corpse out of a torpedo tube, faking their own destruction. The German destroyer continues dropping depth charges. U-571, hiding at below  , is damaged by the high water pressure. Control of the main ballast tanks is lost and the ship ascends uncontrollably. Tyler orders crewman Trigger to submerse himself in the bilge underwater to repressurize the torpedo tubes. 

Trigger uses an air hose to enter the flooded compartment. He closes the air valve to the torpedo tubes, but a second leak and broken valve are found, which Trigger cant reach. U-571 surfaces, unable to fire its last torpedo. The destroyer fires on the ship, which is heavily damaged and begins to flood. The first hit causes pipes to collapse, pinning Triggers leg, after he has left the air hose behind. Unable to turn back, he reaches for the valve and closes it before he dies. The second the pressure is available, Tyler orders Tank to fire the final torpedo. The German destroyer is destroyed. As the crew sigh in relief, Tank reports Triggers death. U-571 has taken severe damage and will not remain afloat for long. The crew abandons ship with the Enigma in their possession. The crew watch U571 as she slips beneath the waves. Floating aboard an inflatable lifeboat, they are eventually rescued by a US Navy PBY Catalina flying boat.

==Controversies regarding content==

===Historical events===
 
 Royal Canadian Navy captured U-774 and the U.S. Navy seized   in June 1944. By this time the Allies were already routinely decoding German naval Enigma traffic.

While the United States direct participation in the Second World War commenced in mid-1941 with Lend-Lease, tactical involvement did not commence until after the Attack on Pearl Harbor, by which time the history of capturing Enigma machines and breaking their codes had already begun in Europe.
 Britain and German invasion of Poland.   
 Captain Joe Baker-Cresswell. The U-boat was  . In 1942, the British seized  , capturing additional Enigma codebooks. According to Britains Channel 4, "The captured codebooks provided vital assistance to British cryptographers such as Alan Turing, at the code-breaking facility of Bletchley Park, near Milton Keynes, Buckinghamshire." 

The capture, rather than sinking, of   – the only ship to be captured by an aircraft – on 27 August 1941 by a Lockheed Hudson from RAF Coastal Command was important for determining the fighting capacity of U-boats, although her crew destroyed the Enigma and cipher information. The boat was towed to port and commissioned into the Royal Navy as  .
 Brian Jenkins MP for Pudsey constituency (which includes Horsforth, a town proud of its connection with HMS Aubretia), U.S. president Bill Clinton wrote assuring that the films plot was only a work of fiction. 
  
 end credits dedicate the film to the "Allied sailors and officers who risked their lives capturing Enigma materials" during the Second World War. The credits acknowledge the Royal Navys role in capturing Enigma machines and code documents from U-110,  U-559 and the U.S. Navys capture of U-505.   

In 2006, screenwriter David Ayer admitted that U-571 distorted history and stated that he would not do it again. 
   Ayer told  , and I would be personally offended if somebody distorted their achievements.}}

===Negative portrayal of U-boat sailors===

The film portrays a scene in which the U-boat sailors kill the Allied merchant crewmen who have survived their ships sinking, in compliance with naval policy and so that the survivors do not report the U-boat position. German U-boat crews were under   ship Peleus. {{cite news url = http://www.pbs.org/wgbh/nova/lostsub/map_u0852.html title = NOVA Online: Hitlers Lost Sub publisher = PBS

===General inaccuracies===
Although the US submariners crewing U-571 successfully sink the German resupply U-boat in an undersea battle, in reality this was extremely difficult for any World War II submarine to achieve. The only instance of a submerged submarines sinking another submerged vessel was the Action of 9 February 1945, when   sank the   with torpedoes. 
 German destroyer in the Atlantic Ocean is a likely inaccuracy, as most of the surface fleet of the Kriegsmarine never ventured far west into the Atlantic (owing to the overwhelming strength of the British, Canadian and US surface fleets), and no German ship did so from 1942 onwards. The few exceptions were their capital ships, such as  ,   and  . 
 Type XIV supply U-boats did not possess torpedo tubes and thus (if historically accurate) could not have attacked S-33. 

In the discussion of the plan to capture the Enigma, Maj. Coonan addresses Lt. Tyler as "sir." As a major in the Marines, he outranked Tyler. A major in the Marines, Army or Air Force is the equivalent of a lieutenant commander in the Navy, which outranks a lieutenant. He might, however, have addressed him as "sir" because he was the submarines executive officer. Also, an executive officer normally holds a rank higher than lieutenant unless the Captain is a Lieutenant commander. However, in the military rank structure, position usually takes precedence over rank.

During the destroyers depth charge attack more than 80 depth charges are detonated in the film, despite the fact that German destroyers rarely carried more than 30 depth charges during the war. {{cite book last = Williamson first = Gordon title = German Destroyers 1939-45 publisher = Osprey Publishing year = 2003 page = 6}} 
 Messerschmitt 109 that buzzes the submarine prior to her encounter with the destroyer is referred to as a "long range reconnaissance" aircraft. In reality, the 109 was a relatively short range aircraft not typically deployed on such duties.

==Deleted scenes== decapitated by flying debris. To get a "PG-13", the shot was redone with Emmett this time knocked overboard by flying debris. This left many audience members not knowing what happened to his character. A death scene was also filmed for Maj. Matthew Coonan (David Keith), but the effect did not work well so it was cut from the film.
