==Production==
 

===Conception===
 
  The Outer Limits since 1995. Upon hearing of MGMs plan to create a television spin-off series of the feature film Stargate (film)|Stargate, Wright and Glassner independently and unbeknownst to each other approached MGM and proposed their concept for the television series. MGM president John Symes greenlit the project on the condition that Wright and Glassner work together as executive producers of the new show.    The show was named Stargate SG-1 after Wright flightily agreed to Symess pitch question of whether the team should be called "SG-1". MGM released posters titled Stargate SG-1 within the next week without the knowledge of Wright or Glassner.   
 Showtime made a two-season commitment for 44 episodes in 1996.  Principal photography began in Vancouver in February 1997. 

===Casting and cast changes===
After Anderson accepted the part, Brad Wright and Jonathan Glassner reviewed several thousand taped auditions and invited approximately 25 promising actors to screen tests in Los Angeles.    Michael Shanks, Amanda Tapping and Christopher Judge are said to have gravitated towards each other during the casting process before they knew that they would ultimately be cast.    The producers found Judge the easiest to cast due to his muscular presence.  Shanks was cast because he did "the perfect imitation of James Spader", according to Wright.  The producers knew Don S. Davis from his work as a stand-in and stunt-double for Dana Elcar in MacGyver and approached him to read for the role of George Hammond.      
 Sci Fi Channel picked up the show  and substituted a new character, played by Corin Nemec. Casting agents had met Nemec in the courtyard of MGMs Santa Monica offices by chance and had offered him the role of Jonas Quinn.    Addressing rumors that it had forced Shankss departure, Sci Fi said in February 2002 that the network had "absolutely never requested that any cast changes be made ... and although we regret the loss of Michael Shanks, we think that Corin Nemec will be a great new presence in the cast."  Nemecs early appearances, beginning with the penultimate episode of season 5 "Meridian (Stargate SG-1)|Meridian", failed to win over some of the shows fans.  Nemec was willing to continue playing the character after season 6 or in a feature film or a spinoff series.  However, the producers reached an agreement with Shanks to return full-time in season 7, leaving Nemec with a recurring role.  Don S. Davis left Stargate SG-1 after season 7 for health reasons  but appeared in a recurring capacity until his death on June 29, 2008.
 Prometheus Unbound".    The producers liked the on-screen chemistry between Blacks Vala Mal Doran and Shankss Daniel so much that they re-introduced her in a six-episode story arc to cover for the maternity leave of Amanda Tapping at the beginning of season 9.    At the same time, Richard Dean Anderson left the show to spend more time with his daughter (his schedule had been reduced incrementally since season 6).  The role of the leading man was filled with Ben Browder (also of Farscape fame), who had met with the Stargate producers as soon as the introduction of new main characters for season 9 was discussed.    The producers had met him during sci-fi conventions and had previously discussed casting him in other Stargate roles.    The producers approached Emmy Award-winning actor Beau Bridges directly to play the role of Hank Landry.    Claudia Blacks guest appearances were so popular with the cast, crew and audience     that the actress returned for the last two season 9 episodes (with her pregnancy worked into the plot), and she joined the cast full-time in season 10.

===Crew===
 
Most of the producers, crew members and guest actors involved in Stargate SG-1 were Canadian.  Creators Brad Wright and Jonathan Glassner were executive producers and show runners of Stargate SG-1 in the first three seasons,  having the final say (besides MGM and the network) on stories, designs, effects, casting, editing, and episode budgets.  After Glassners departure, Wright ran Stargate SG-1 alone for three seasons.  Executive producer Robert C. Cooper took over as show-runner in season 7 when Brad Wright took time off to develop the Spin-off (media)|spin-off series Stargate Atlantis.  Cooper and Wright remained show-runners of their respective shows until the end of SG-1.  Also serving as executive and co-executive producers were Michael Greenburg and Richard Dean Anderson (seasons 1–8), N. John Smith (seasons 4–10), and the writer team Joseph Mallozzi & Paul Mullie (seasons 7–10).
 Alan McCullough Martin Wood and Peter DeLuise directed the most episodes, with 46 episodes (seasons 1–10) and 57 episodes (seasons 2–10), respectively. Wood and DeLuise regularly made cameo appearances in their episodes and notably played the show-within-a-show directors in the cameo-heavy milestone episodes "Wormhole X-Treme!" and "200 (Stargate SG-1)|200". Andy Mikita had been an assistant director since the pilot episode and directed 29 episodes from season 3 through 10. SG-1 director of photography Peter Woeste and camera operator William Waring directed 13 episodes each. Most staff writers and staff directors held producer positions. Several cast members also contributed story ideas and directed SG-1 episodes.

===Filming===
  Crystal Skull" was the first episode to be filmed on a virtual set. 

The main setting of Stargate SG-1, the fictional Stargate Command (SGC) at the (real) Cheyenne Mountain Air Force Station near Colorado Springs, Colorado, was filmed at stage 5 of The Bridge Studios.  Martin Wood filmed half a dozen stock shots of the real Cheyenne Mountain complex for use in the series approximately ten days before the premiere of the pilot episode. Although these shots wore out over the years, the producers did not film new shots until the beginning of season 9, thinking that Stargate SG-1 would be cancelled after each current year.       By then, visitor questions and fan theories about the existence of a Stargate at the real Cheyenne Mountain complex had become so common that Cheyenne Mountain had installed a seemingly high-security door labeled "Stargate Command" for one of their storage rooms holding brooms and detergent.   

The first seven seasons had 22 episodes each, which was reduced to 20 episodes for the last three seasons. Episodes of the first seasons were filmed over a period of 7.5 working days, which decreased to a targeted average of six working days in the last seasons.  All episodes were filmed in   wide-screen, although Stargate SG-1 was broadcast in   aspect ratio in its first years.    The transition to the broadcast of episodes in the wider 16:9 ratio gave directors more freedom in frame composition.    The first three seasons of Stargate SG-1 were filmed on 16 mm film|16&nbsp;mm film, notwithstanding scenes involving visual effects that had always been shot on 35 mm film|35&nbsp;mm film for various technical reasons. After a test run with the season 3 finale, "Nemesis (Stargate SG-1)|Nemesis", Stargate SG-1 switched to 35&nbsp;mm film for all purposes at the beginning of season 4.    Digital HD cameras were used for filming beginning with season 8.   

===Production design===
 
 
The art department generated all of the concepts and drawing for the prop department, the set decoration department, the construction department, the paint department, and the model shop. They also collaborated with the visual effects department.    Stargate SG-1 employed about 200 Canadian union workers, although that number could exceed 300 when new sets were built.  Lead production designer Richard Hudolin joined the project in October 1996. Bridget McGuire, SG-1 s art director since the pilot episode, took over as lead production designer in season 6.  
 prop stored outside in the Californian desert. Although the prop had severely deteriorated, he was able to take a detailed mold for Stargate SG-1 production to build its own prop. The new Stargate was engineered to turn, to lock the chevrons, and to be computer-controlled to dial specific gate addresses. A portable Stargate prop was built for on-location shoots and required six workers and one full day to set up.   Since visual effects are sometimes faster and cheaper,  a computer-generated Stargate was occasionally used in on-location shoots in later seasons. 

The SGC set had to be twice as high for shooting as the   Stargate prop,  but one of Hudolins original plans of a three-level set was rejected in favor of a two-level set.  The gateroom was the biggest room on set and could be redesigned for other scenes.    Two multi-purpose rooms were frequently redecorated into the infirmary, Daniels lab, the cafeteria or the gym.     The SGC set and all other sets from the pilot episode were constructed within six weeks in January and February 1997, incorporating some original set pieces from the feature film.    The SGC set would be largely dismantled in late 2008 to make room for the Icarus Base set of Stargate Universe.   

===Make-up and costumes===
Most of the main SG-1 characters are US airmen and wear authentic United States Air Force uniforms. During missions, the members of the SG-1 team normally wear olive green Battle Dress Uniforms.  Richard Dean Anderson and Don S. Davis received a regular military-style haircut on set.     Amanda Tapping had her hair comparably short until the filming of the direct-to-DVD films. Playing a civilian, Michael Shanks adopted James Spaders hairstyle from the feature film but cut it short for the season 2 finale and subsequent seasons.  The Jaffa alien Tealc (Christopher Judge) was the only main character whose look required more than basic make-up. His Egyptian look was reflective of the Goauld Ra from the feature film and was complemented with a forehead symbol and a gold skin tone, although his make-up process was simplified over the years.    Judge shaved his head at home each day until the producers allowed him to let his hair grow in season 8.  As a trained nurse, key make-up artist Jan Newman could make burns, cuts, bruises and the SG-1 teams other wounds look authentic. 
 Unas race required elaborate prosthetics and make-up work.  To convey the cultural origins of the various fictional human civilizations living on different planets after their displacement from Earth, the costume designers combined elements of their respective Earth cultures with modern fabrics, elaborate trims and chains to produce a historically rooted yet otherworldly appearance.    The look of the Goauld such as Apophis was initially based on the look of Ra in the feature film.  For the design of the Ori and the Priors in season 9, the art department looked at Japanese and Samurai garments for costume design. Art director James Robbins found the face painting, scarification and burns of remote jungle tribes mystical, and these served as inspiration for the face scarification of the Priors and the Doci. Early ideas to include finger extensions and scarification on these characters hands were discarded as impracticable.   

===Visual effects===
Stargate SG-1 was one of the biggest employers in the Vancouver visual effects market,  spending $400,000 per episode.  The largest role was played by Rainmaker Digital Effects,  whose senior digital compositing artist, Bruce Woloshyn, worked approximately 10 months a year in close collaboration with SG-1  visual effects supervisor/producer James Tichenor and visual effects supervisor Michelle Comens.  Many companies were hired to create the Stargates water-like event horizon in the beginning, but Rainmaker eventually became the only company to create those visual effects.  Rainmakers regular effects shots included the activation and use of the Stargate itself (with well over 300 event horizon shots in the first few years), the transport rings, and the blast shots of the staff weapons and zat guns. They created the visual effects for Goauld cargo ships and death gliders on a less regular basis.   
 Lost City" receiving the most visual effects awards and nominations (see List of awards and nominations received by Stargate SG-1).

===Music===
According to composer Joel Goldsmith, Stargate SG-1 had a traditional action-adventure score, "with a sci-fi, fantasy flair" that goes "from comedy to drama to wondrous to suspense to heavy action to ethereal".  Brad Wright and Jonathan Glassner had known Goldsmith since the second season of The Outer Limits before they approached him to work on the pilot episode of Stargate SG-1. Goldsmith and David Arnold, the composer of the original feature film score, discussed themes for a television adaptation. The main titles of Stargate SG-1 were a medley of several themes from the feature film, although Goldsmith also wrote a unique end title for SG-1 to establish the show as its own entity.  MGM eventually insisted on using Arnolds score in the pilot episode instead of Goldsmiths, but Brad Wrights 2009 direct-to-DVD recut of Children of the Gods uses Goldsmiths original score. 

For each episodes score, Goldsmith simulated a real orchestra with a synthesizer palette of an eighty-piece symphony orchestra for budgetary reasons,  although he occasionally used two or three musicians for added orchestral authenticity.  Goldsmiths long-time assistant Neal Acree started composing additional music for Stargate SG-1 in season 8.  The amount of composed music varied between 12 and 33 minutes out of a 44-minute episode, with an average of around 22 to 26 minutes,    making the full symphonic score of SG-1 more time-consuming to create than for general TV shows.  Since Goldsmith lived a thousand miles away from Vancouver, he and the producers discussed ideas over the phone Gibson 2003, pp. 150–151.  and exchanged tapes via Federal Express for several years until the show switched to Internet file transfers.   
 Shades of Fragile Balance", and Creedence Clearwater Revival|CCRs song "Have You Ever Seen the Rain?" played in the series finale "Unending". A television soundtrack with Goldsmiths adapted score was released in 1997,    followed by a best-of release in 2001.     In Season 1 Episode 7, The Nox, the music that played when The Nox appeared was Spinning The Silk from the album Chrysalis by 2002.

===Opening title sequence===
Stargate SG-1 has had several opening title sequences, which are generally preceded by a teaser act. The credits are normally sixty seconds long. Richard Dean Anderson was the only SG-1 actor whose name appeared before the shows title. Michael Shankss name was moved near the end of the opening credits with the appendage "as Daniel Jackson" after his return to the show in season 7. Some DVD versions of early SG-1 seasons have different opening credits than the television versions, as do the direct-to-DVD films. Composer Joel Goldsmith adapted David Arnolds Stargate feature film score for SG-1 s opening title theme, which remained the same during the run of Stargate SG-1 and its direct-to-DVD films.

The first opening title sequence, used in the first five seasons, shows a slow-pan camera move over Ras mask. The Stargate SG-1 producers had run out of time before the premiere of season 1 and simply re-used the accelerated opening title sequence of the feature film.  Ras mask had been created in the feature films model shop and had originally been filmed with a motion control photography|motion-control camera.  Partly because Ras mask looked cross-eyed, Brad Wright approached the art department in the following years to produce a new opening title sequence; however, the sequence remained the same until the shows move to the Sci-Fi Channel. During the first five seasons when the show was syndicated a separate introduction was used; this intro is still used by Sci-Fi for seasons 1-5. This version uses action shots of the original cast.

==Themes and allusions==
 
  Egyptian mythology Asgard ally), Ancient ally against the god-like Ori (Stargate)|Ori), among others. SG-1 introduces new alien races (as opposed to alien human civilizations) less often than other science fiction television series and integrates newly encountered races or visited planets in stand-alone episodes into its established mythology while leaving the plotlines accessible for new audience members.  Despite the shows extensive intergalactic mythology and science fiction elements, scholar M. Keith Booker considered SG-1 ultimately character-driven and heavily dependent on the camaraderie among the SG-1 members. Booker 2004, pp. 181–182. 

The producers embraced humor and wanted SG-1 to be a fun show that did not take itself too seriously.  Brad Wright regarded SG-1 as a family show with adequate violence as opposed to random or gratuitous violence.  Christopher Judge did not consider SG-1 as a "message show by any stretch of the imagination, but occasionally there are messages there".  Aimed at a popular audience, Stargate SG-1 emphasized its present-day-Earth story frame by frequently referencing   references into his own scripts since the first season, which the other writers imitated after Richard Dean Anderson began referencing the film on his own.    ONeill references Richard Dean Andersons favorite television series,   a system for the gate on Earth") and in a Farscape vignette in the milestone episode "200 (Stargate SG-1)|200".

==Broadcast and release==
 

===Showtime and US syndication (1997–2002)=== Showtime ordered the first two seasons of Stargate SG-1 with 44 episodes total in 1996.  The two-hour pilot episode received Showtimes highest-ever ratings for a series premiere with an audience of approximately 1.5 million households in the 8 p.m. Sunday slot of July 27, 1997.   According to the SG-1 producers, a broadcast network would have cancelled SG-1 after a few episodes, but Showtime put no pressure on the show to "deliver the meteoric ratings the way network shows do".  The show was consistently the channels most-watched program (including theatrical movies),   so Showtime ordered a third and fourth season of 22 episodes each in July 1998, 

Since Stargate SG-1 was expensive to produce, MGM arranged an agreement with Showtime that SG-1 could air in syndication six months after their premiere on Showtime.    All 22  .  Showtime decided to end its association with Stargate SG-1 at the end of season 5, saying that the show still had a sizeable viewership but could no longer draw new subscribers due to its availability in syndication.   

===Sci Fi Channel and US syndication (2002–2007)=== The Dead Zone and Farscape, while it aired older SG-1 episodes in a four-hour block every Monday at 7 p.m. Episodes were broadcast in US syndication six months after their premiere on Sci Fi.  The sixth season was supposed to be the shows last,  but Sci Fi renewed SG-1 at the last minute.  The sixth and seventh seasons made Stargate SG-1 Sci Fis highest-rated original series with an average of 2 million viewers in over 1.3 million households,      elevating Sci Fi into the top 10 cable networks in the United States.    For the next few years, the producers believed each current season to be the shows last and repeatedly wrote big series finales,    but the success of Stargate SG-1 put off their plans of ending the show to write a new Stargate feature film.  Sci Fi cut the length of an SG-1 season from 22 to 20 episodes from season 8 onwards.
 Battlestar Galactica joined the two Stargate series in January 2005, making Sci Fi the leader among basic cablers on Friday nights over the summer of 2005.   The producers considered replacing Stargate SG-1 with a new show named Stargate Command after SG-1 s eighth season,    but the Sci Fi Channel decided to continue SG-1 with a slightly changed cast for a ninth season instead. Season 9s average slipped from 2.4 million viewers in late 2005    to 2.1 million viewers with 1.8 household rating during early 2006, which Sci Fis Mark Stern attributed to the "tech-savvy, toy-loving, time-shifting audience" whose use of digital video recorders excluded them in ratings compilations.  Meanwhile, the decline of SG-1  2005–2006 syndication household ratings was consistent with the overall decline in syndicated sci-fi action hours.  Sci Fi ordered a record-breaking tenth season of SG-1 in 2005, but announced it would not renew the show for an eleventh season in summer 2006 (see #Cancellation and future). The final SG-1 episode, "Unending", premiered on Sky1 in the UK on March 13, 2007, and attracted approximately 2.2 million viewers on the Sci Fi Channel on June 22, 2007.   

===International broadcast===
According to Wright and Cooper, the worldwide popularity of science fiction was a factor in SG-1  success and the good international reception helped keep the series on the air in the beginning.  Several newspapers reported in 2005–2006 that Stargate SG-1 aired in over 100 countries with a weekly worldwide viewership of around 10 million,        but The New York Times gave different numbers in 2004, saying that the show was broadcast in sixty-four countries with more than 17 million viewers a week.

In April 2009, MGM confirmed a third new SG-1 film that Brad Wright had first announced in May 2008.   Joseph Mallozzi revealed the working title as Stargate: Revolution.    The film was planned to be written by Wright and former Stargate Atlantis executive producer Carl Binder.  Martin Wood would serve as director.  The premise of the film would have been the "possibility of the Stargate program going public".    According to Wright, the film would center on the Jack ONeill character and would reunite as many of the SG-1 cast as possible, depending on the cost of the film and actor availability.    The character of Vala Mal Doran would not appear in the film.    Amanda Tapping confirmed her appearance in this SG-1 film and the first Atlantis movie in September 2008,    and Michael Shanks (Daniel Jackson) confirmed his and Richard Dean Andersons participation in January 2009.    No contracts had been signed by April 2009,    but Wright stated that he "can almost guarantee we are proceeding with the SG-1 movie this year  ".  Nevertheless, production was put on hold. Wright explained that the late-2000s recession made DVD premieres less lucrative for MGM than in the years before,  and he also pointed to the financial crisis of MGM as reason for the delay.    Wright and Joe Mallozzi expressed optimism that production would eventually start,     until Wright announced in April 2011 that the SG-1 film project was permanently shelved, along with plans for future Atlantis and Stargate Universe films and a cross-over film incorporating elements from all three series.     By then, neither the Atlantis nor Universe television series were produced anymore. Still, Wright did not rule out future Stargate films, saying; "Its a franchise. Stargate is not over. Somebody smart from MGM is going to figure it out, and something will happen."

===Critical reception===
In his review for the pilot episode "Children of the Gods" in 1997, Will Joyner of The New York Times considered Stargate SG-1 a "challenging, if derivative, mix" that is "more than a Stargate   fan might expect but certainly less than one would hope for." He had a mixed opinion about the cast and was disturbed by SG-1  use of visual shock tactics to make up for its lower television budget.    Reviewing the same episode, Variety (magazine)|Variety  Tony Scott criticized that "superficial characters wander through their roles without stirring a modicum of conviction" in a show that is "essentially for young people". He mocked that the wooden acting, "pedestrian writing, pulp-mag plotting, shopworn characters, hackneyed dialogue   and Mario Azzopardis broad direction will all undoubtedly delight billions and billions."  Many critics responded negatively to the gratuitous use of sexual implication and female nudity in the pilot episode, which according to Wright had been filmed on Showtimes insistence despite his vocal opposition and was cut from the pilots 2009 direct-to-DVD version. 
 Battlestar Galactica, although every week, the show attracts an average of 10 million viewers worldwide. It has also been pointed out by Cooper that "By the way, neither did the original Star Trek in its time, It wasnt until 30 years later that people started looking back at it and realizing it was a milestone. I think we secretly hope that 10, 15, 20 years from now, that Stargate will be considered in the same way."  Scott D. Pierce from Deseret News said that the series never made a "sort of cultural impact" as Star Trek because the show was "pretty derivative" which he further stated it became "more so over the years."  Robert Hanks from the British newspaper The Independent said that the series "Did the job" during its second season of broadcasting.
