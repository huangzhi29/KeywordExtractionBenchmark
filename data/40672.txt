==Plot== Little Italy. mafioso named Tony (Danny Aiello). Léon spends his idle time engaging in calisthenics, nurturing a houseplant, and watching old films.
 DEA agents, who have been paying him to stash cocaine in his apartment. After they discover he has been cutting the cocaine to keep some for himself, DEA&nbsp;agents storm the building, led by sharply-dressed drug addict Norman Stansfield (Gary Oldman). During the raid, Stansfield quickly becomes unhinged and murders Mathildas entire family one by one, while Mathilda is out shopping. When Mathilda returns she realizes what has happened just in time to continue down the hall, where she desperately knocks on her neighbours door. A hesitant Léon gives her shelter.

Mathilda quickly discovers that Léon is a hitman. She begs him to take care of her and to teach her his skills, as she wants to avenge the murder of her four-year-old brother. Léon trains Mathilda and shows her how to use various weapons. In return, she runs his errands, cleans his apartment, and teaches him how to read. Mathilda tells Léon she loves him several times, but he offers no response.

 
One day after Mathilda has learned how to shoot, she fills a bag with guns from Léons collection and sets out to kill Stansfield. She bluffs her way into the DEA office by posing as a delivery girl, only to be ambushed by Stansfield in a bathroom. Mathilda learns from Stansfield that Léon killed one of the corrupt DEA agents in Chinatown that morning. Léon, after discovering her plan in a note left for him, rescues Mathilda, shooting two more of Stansfields men in the process. A now enraged Stansfield goes to find Tony, and assaults him in order to find out where Léon is.
 NYPD ESU team sent by Stansfield captures her and attempts to infiltrate Léons apartment. Léon ambushes the ESU team and grabs Mathilda. Back in his apartment, Léon creates a quick escape for Mathilda by smashing a hole in an air shaft. He reassures her and tells her that he loves her and that she has given him "a taste for life", moments before the police come for him. In the chaos that follows, Léon sneaks out of the building disguised as a wounded ESU officer. He goes unnoticed save for Stansfield, who recognizes him, follows him downstairs and shoots him in the back. As he is dying, Léon places an object in Stansfields hands that he says is "from Mathilda". Opening his hands, Stansfield discovers that it is the pin from a grenade. He then opens Léons vest to find a cluster of active grenades, which detonate moments later, killing them both.

Mathilda heads to see Tony, as Léon had instructed her to do before he died. Tony reveals to Mathilda that Léon instructed him to give his money to her if anything happened to him. He offers to hold the money and provide it to her on an allowance basis, on account of her youth. Mathilda asks Tony to give her a job as a hitman; Tony angrily declines, telling Mathilda to forget about her ordeal and return to school. Mathilda meets with the school headmistress, who readmits her. She then walks into a field near the school to plant Leons houseplant, as she had told Léon he should, to give it roots.

The British band Alt-J released a song about the film, titled Matilda (alt-J song)|Matilda  . The first line in the lyrics, "this is from Matilda", refer to Leons last words to Norman Stansfield, shortly before the grenades detonate and take their lives.

== Sequel ==
It has been claimed that Besson has written the script for a sequel, which Transporter&nbsp;3 director Olivier Megaton was to direct and in which Portman would reprise the Mathilda role. Filming was to be delayed until Portman was a bit older. However, in the meantime, Besson left Gaumont Film Company to start his own movie studio, EuropaCorp. Unhappy at Bessons departure, Gaumont Film Company "has held The Professional rights close to the vest — and will not budge". According to Megaton, the sequel will more than likely never happen.  

== Extended version ==
There is also an extended version of the film, referred to as "international version," "version longue," or "version intégrale". Containing 25&nbsp;minutes of additional footage, it is sometimes called the "Directors Cut" but Besson refers to the original version as the Directors Cut and the new version as "The Long Version".  According to Luc Besson, this is the version he wanted to release, but for the fact that the extra scenes tested poorly with Los Angeles preview audiences. The additional material is found in the films second act, and it depicts more of the interactions and relationship between Léon and Mathilda, as well as explicitly demonstrating how Mathilda accompanies Léon on several of his hits as "a full co-conspirator", to further her training as a contract killer. 

Léon: Version Intégrale was released in France in 1996; in the United States, where the film was originally released as The Professional, it was released on DVD as Léon: The Professional in 2000. Both versions contain the additional footage.
