==Plot==
In a frame story, a man (Peter Falk) reads a book to his sick grandson (Fred Savage). Scenes of the reading occasionally interrupt the main story.

A young woman named Buttercup (Robin Wright) lives on a farm in the country of Florin. Whenever she gives her farm boy Westley (Cary Elwes) an order, he answers "as you wish" and happily complies. Eventually, she realizes that he means "I love you"&mdash;and that she loves him too. Westley leaves to seek his fortune so they can marry, but his ship is attacked by the Dread Pirate Roberts, who famously never leaves anyone alive.

Five years later, Buttercup reluctantly agrees to marry Prince Humperdinck ( ), a giant named Fezzik (André the Giant), and a Spanish master fencer named Inigo Montoya (Mandy Patinkin), who seeks revenge against the polydactyly|six-fingered man who killed his father. Two separate forces pursue them: Prince Humperdinck with a complement of soldiers, and a masked man dressed in black. The outlaws were actually hired by Humperdinck himself to make a pretext for war by leaving Buttercups dead body on the shores of rival country Guilder.
 swordfight and knocks him unconscious. He then defeats Fezzik in hand-to-hand combat, choking him until he blacks out. Finally, he kills Vizzini in a battle of wits by tricking him into drinking poison, and so captures Buttercup. When he tells her he is the Dread Pirate Roberts, she becomes enraged at him for killing Westley and shoves him down a slope. As he falls he calls out "As you wish" and Buttercup realizes that the man is, in fact, Westley. Buttercup chases after him and learns that the previous Dread Pirate Roberts had offered his identity to Westley in order to be able to retire&mdash;which was also how that "Roberts" had acquired his identity.

The duo manage to cross the Fire Swamp with its fire spouts, lightning sand, and Rodents of Unusual Size, but are captured by Humperdinck and his   six-fingered vizier Count Rugen (Christopher Guest).

Buttercup agrees to return with Humperdinck in exchange for Westleys release, but Humperdinck secretly has Rugen imprison and torture Westley in the Pit of Despair. Later, when Buttercup expresses unhappiness at marrying Humperdinck, he promises to search for Westley. Eventually Buttercup realizes he is lying and taunts him as a coward. Humperdinck, enraged, tortures Westley to his death.

Meanwhile, Fezzik finds Inigo and informs him of Rugens existence. Inigo decides that they need the man in blacks help to get into the castle. Hearing cries of anguish, they reach Rugens torture chamber only to find Westley dead. But they take him to Miracle Max (Billy Crystal), who explains that Westley is "only mostly dead", and supplies a pill to revive him. With the wedding imminent, they give Westley the pill too early and he awakens partially paralyzed. Still, Westley, Inigo, and Fezzik invade the castle. Humperdinck drastically abridges the wedding ceremony and locks Buttercup into her chambers.

Meanwhile Inigo finds and duels Rugen. Seriously wounded early in the battle, he begins repeatedly reciting his long-rehearsed greeting of vengeance: "Hello, my name is Inigo Montoya. You killed my father. Prepare to die." This restores his focus and he finally slays his nemesis.

Westley finds Buttercup about to commit suicide, and assures her that her marriage is void because they skipped saying "I do." Humperdinck confronts them but Westley bluffs him into surrendering, leaving him tied up, to contemplate his cowardice. Westley rides away triumphantly with Buttercup, Inigo, and Fezzik on horses that Fezzik conveniently discovers. As they leave, Inigo remarks that now that he has his revenge he isnt sure what to do next; Westley suggests he become the next Dread Pirate Roberts.

At last Westley and Buttercup share a passionate kiss. As the grandfather finishes the story and prepares to leave, the boy asks him to read the story again the next day. The grandfather smiles and replies, "As you wish."

==Development==
There had been many attempts to turn the novel into a film. In 1973, 20th Century Fox paid Goldman $500,000 for the film rights and to do a screenplay.  Richard Lester was signed to direct and the movie was almost made, but then the head of production at Fox was fired and the project was put on hiatus. Goldman subsequently bought back the film rights to the novel with his own money.  The movie almost got financed several times over the next decade — at one stage in the early 1980s Christopher Reeve was interested in playing Westley  — before Rob Reiner managed to secure funding from Norman Lear.

 fence (both Bob Anderson and Peter Diamond, and with each other). They actually performed all of the fencing in the sword fight scene, although stunt doubles were used for the two somersaults. 

Popular professional wrestler André the Giant had undergone major back surgery prior to filming and, despite his great size and strength, could not support the weight of Cary Elwes during their fight scene or Robin Wright for a scene at the end of the film. For the wrestling scene, when Elwes was pretending to hang on Andrés back, he was actually walking on a series of ramps below the camera during close-ups. For the wide shots, a stunt double took the place of André. 

==Soundtrack==
 
The original soundtrack album was composed by Mark Knopfler, and released by Warner Bros. Records in the United States and Vertigo Records internationally in November 1987. The album contains the song "Storybook Love", performed by Willy DeVille and co-written with Mark Knopfler. It was nominated for an Academy Award for Best Original Song at the 60th Academy Awards.

==Adaptations==
It was announced that Tony Award-winning composer Adam Guettel was working with William Goldman on a musical adaptation of The Princess Bride in 2006. The project was abandoned though, in February 2007 after Goldman reportedly demanded 75 percent of the authors share, even though Guettel was writing both the music and the lyrics.  Some of Guettels music for the production has since surfaced in concert performances and workshops. 

In 2008, PlayRoom Entertainment released The Princess Bride: Storming the Castle, a board game based on the film.
