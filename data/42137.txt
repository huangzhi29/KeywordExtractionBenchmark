==DeMilles opening remarks==
"We bring you the circus&nbsp;— that Pied Piper whose magic tunes lead children of all ages into a tinseled and spun-candied world of reckless beauty and mounting laughter; whirling thrills; of rhythm, excitement and grace; of daring, enflaring and dance; of high-stepping horses and high-flying stars.
 tragedy stalk the Big Top, haunts the back yard, and rides the circus train&nbsp;— where Death is constantly watching for one frayed rope, one weak link, or one trace of fear.

"A fierce, primitive fighting force that smashes relentlessly forward against impossible odds: That is the circus&nbsp;— and this is the story of the biggest of the Big Tops&nbsp;— and of the men and women who fight to make it&nbsp;— The Greatest Show On Earth!"

==Plot==
Brad Braden is the no-nonsense general manager of what was at the time the worlds largest railroad circus.  He has a number of problems on his hands for the upcoming season.

The shows board of directors plan to run a short 10 week season rather than risk losing $25,000 a day in a shaky post-war economy. Brad bargains to keep the circus on the road as long as it is making a profit, thus keeping the 1,400 performers and roustabouts who make Ringling Bros. and Barnum & Bailey Circus the Greatest Show On Earth employed.

Brads first problem is having to tell his girlfriend, Holly, a flyer who has been expecting to be the star of that seasons show, that shes out of the center ring. The only way he was able to get management to agree to a full season was to hire The Great Sebastian, "the debonair King of the Air" and world-class trapeze artist, as the star of the show. Holly knows Brad must think of the circus first and personal feelings second, and that he does not take chances with the show, but is nevertheless infuriated at his decision.

His second problem is keeping Sebastian under control. He has a well-deserved reputation as a ladies man who has cut a wide swath through the female contingent of every show hes ever worked in, to the detriment of the running of those shows.

His third problem is keeping an eye on Harry, a midway concessionaire he suspects of running crooked games of chance,  who works for a mysterious gangster named Mr. Henderson (who has a healthy respect for Brad Braden and not much for Harry).

Another situation unbeknownst to Brad involves the beloved Buttons the Clown, who is never seen without his makeup. During a performance, Buttons converses with a woman member of the audience &mdash; who warns him that an unnamed "they" are asking questions about him again. She is in fact his mother and they see each other only once a year. Hints about his former life are revealed as he gives first aid to performers and wraps bandages around a trapeze for Holly in an expert manner. Holly later finds a newspaper article about a doctor who had euthanasia|"mercy killed" his wife, but does not immediately make the connection to Buttons.

The competition between Holly and Sebastian for the center ring develops into a romantic triangle as well, with both Sebastian and Brad vying for Holly as the   and suffers serious injuries in a fall when a trick goes wrong. Buttons tends to him, and when a doctor expresses admiration for the way he dealt with the injuries the clown explains, a little nervously, that he used to be a Pharmacists Mate|pharmacists mate. Holly finally has the center ring and star billing  &mdash; but not the way she wanted it. Brad is unable to comfort her because she is in love with Sebastian.

One problem at least is resolved. When Harry is caught cheating circus attendees on the midway, Brad calls him on it and fires him, finishing the fight Harry started by throwing him into a puddle of mud. Harry leaves the lot, vowing revenge. He is seen now and then on the periphery of the show, shooting craps and sowing disaffection, particularly with Klaus (Lyle Bettger) the elephant trainer who is obsessed with Angel, one of the "ballet girls" (female performers whose primary job is to look beautiful, as opposed to performing a specialty act) who works with his elephants as "the Sultans Favorite."

Sebastian rejoins the show, but is unable to return to the trapeze because his injuries from that fall have left him with a useless right arm. A guilt-ridden Holly professes her love for her former rival over the cold, unfeeling Brad. Calling Holly a fool "for busting up the swellest guy in the circus," Angel makes a pass at Brad and they become an item. This sits badly with Klaus, who has spent the entire season pursuing Angel. He cannot accept that she is not in love with him and does not want him.

As they are about to leave one stand, Special Agent Gregory of the FBI intercepts Brad, asking if the circus doctor looks like the photograph of a man he is hunting (the photo is of Buttons without makeup). Having never seen Buttons without makeup, Brad doesnt recognize the man in the photo. The detective boards the train to continue his investigation.  Brad mentions this to Buttons, who tells him that Sebastian has feeling in his injured hand &mdash; a sign that his disability is not permanent.  Brad makes the connection between Buttons and the fugitive doctor and comments that the police will be taking fingerprints at the next stand. The implication is that Buttons should make himself scarce until the detective leaves the show to search elsewhere.

The joy of Sebastians potential recovery is overshadowed by a spectacular collision of the circus two trains, set up by Harry, the crooked midway operator fired by Brad, and Angels rejected suitor, Klaus, as a byproduct of their robbing the circus pay wagon of the money earned by the show at the last stand.  Buttons, who had been about to flee, returns after a plea from Holly who like Brad had made the connection between the doctor "who killed the wife he loved, then vanished" and his new identity as Buttons the Clown. Buttons saves the critically injured Brad by giving him a blood transfusion from Sebastian "on the fly," despite knowing that Gregory is watching. This in turn leads to Gregory reluctantly arresting Buttons, whom he declares "is all right."
 open air show by the crash site (as the Big Top and lighting were lost in the wreck). Brads brush with death forces him to admit that he is in love with Holly, but ironically she now hasnt time for him because the show must go on. The final loose end is tied up when Sebastian proposes to Angel and she accepts. The movie ends with the troupe mounting a "spec" to open their improvised performance, which will keep the show in the black and enable them to continue their tour, a magnificent recovery from disaster.
