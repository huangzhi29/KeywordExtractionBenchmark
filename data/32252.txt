==Plot==
Elijah Price (Samuel L. Jackson) is born with Type I osteogenesis imperfecta, a rare disease in which bones break easily. As revealed later in flashbacks, Elijah draws a theory, based on the comic books he has read during his many hospital stays, that if he is representative of one extreme of human frailty, then perhaps there is someone "unbreakable" at the opposite extreme.

He grapples with the janitor, ultimately strangling him to death. That night, he reconciles with Audrey.  The following morning, he secretly shows the newspaper article of his anonymous heroic act to his son.

David attends an exhibition at Elijahs comic book art gallery and meets Elijahs mother (Charlayne Woodard). After talking with Elijah in the back room of his studio, David shakes his hand and sees visions indicating that Elijah orchestrated the three fatal disasters he had mentioned, including Davids train accident, causing hundreds of deaths. Elijah insists the deaths were justified as a means to find David. Calling himself Mr. Glass (based on a nickname he was teased with in school), he explains that his own purpose in life is to be Davids antithesis, David being the hero and he the arch-villain.

==Development==

===Production===
When M. Night Shyamalan conceived the idea for Unbreakable, the outline had a comic books traditional three-part structure (the superheros "birth", his struggles against general evil-doers, and the heros ultimate battle against the "archenemy"). Finding the birth section most interesting, he decided to write Unbreakable as an origin story. During the filming of The Sixth Sense, Shyamalan had already approached Bruce Willis for the lead role of David Dunn. M. Night Shyamalan, Bruce Willis, Samuel L. Jackson, Barry Mendel, Sam Mercer, Eduardo Serra, James Newton Howard, The Making of Unbreakable, 2001, Walt Disney Studios Home Entertainment  With Willis and Samuel L. Jackson specifically in mind for the two leading characters, Shyamalan began to write Unbreakable as a spec script  during post-production on The Sixth Sense. 
 Walt Disney Touchstone banner, Robin Wright Penn was cast in her place.  Principal photography began on April 25, 2000 and ended that July. The majority of filming took place in Philadelphia, Pennsylvania, the films setting. 
 comic book narrative motifs statesman Frederick Douglass.  As he does in his other films, Shyamalan makes a cameo appearance. He plays a man David suspects of dealing drugs inside the stadium. More than 15 minutes of footage was deleted during post-production of Unbreakable. These scenes are available on the DVD release. 

Willis and Jackson had previously worked together on Die Hard with a Vengeance, Pulp Fiction and Loaded Weapon 1.

===Music===
Film score composer James Newton Howard was approached by Shyamalan to work on Unbreakable immediately after scoring The Sixth Sense. "He sat there and storyboarded the whole movie for me", Howard said. "Ive never had a director do that for me."  Shyamalan wanted a "singularity" tone for the music. "He wanted something that was very different, very distinctive, that immediately evoked the movie when people heard it,"  Howard explained. Howard and Shyamalan chose to simplify the score, and minimized the number of instruments (strings, trumpets and piano), with limited orchestrations. Some compositions were recorded in a converted church in London. "You could have recorded the same music in a studio in Los Angeles, and it would have been great, but there is something about the sound of that church studio," Howard remarked. "Its definitely more misterioso."

As in comic books, the main characters have their identified color schemes and aliases. Davids are green and "Security" or "Hero", while Elijahs are purple and "Mr. Glass". The colors show up in their clothes, the wallpaper and bed sheets in their houses, Elijahs note to David, and various personal items.  The people whose bad deeds are sensed by David are identified by an article of clothing in a single bright color (red, orange), to contrast them with the dark and dreary color scheme typical of the rest of the movie (but not of most comic books). Several scenes also depict characters through reflections or doorways, as if framing them in a picture similar to comic books.

In this case, its the mythological world and, in these modern times, the secret design to that labyrinth, the key to the path, is contained in comic books." 

Kenneth Turan, writing in the Los Angeles Times, gave a negative review, arguing that Unbreakable had no originality. "Whether it means to or not, the shadow of The Sixth Sense hangs over Unbreakable," Turan reasoned. "If The Sixth Sense hadnt been as big a success as it was, this story might have been assigned to oblivion, or at least to rewrite."
