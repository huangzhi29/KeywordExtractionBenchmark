==Plot==
A Mexican village is periodically raided for food and supplies by bandits led by Calvera (Eli Wallach). As he and his men ride away from their latest visit, Calvera promises to return for more booty and loot the village again. Taking what meager goods they have, the village leaders ride to a town just inside the American border hoping to barter for weapons to defend themselves. While there, they encounter Chris Adams (Yul Brynner), a veteran Cajun gunslinger; after listening to their tale, Chris suggests that the village hire more gunfighters as they would be cheaper than guns and ammunition. The village men relentlessly try to convince him to be their gunman; while at first he agrees just to help them find men, eventually he decides to help them out in person and find six other men to join them, despite the poor pay offered.

The other men include hotheaded, inexperienced Chico (Horst Buchholz); Chriss friend Harry Luck (Brad Dexter) who believes Chris is seeking treasure; the drifter Vin Tanner (Steve McQueen), who has gone broke after a round of gambling and is loath to accept a position as a store clerk; Bernardo OReilly (Charles Bronson), a gunfighter of Irish-Mexican heritage who has fallen on hard times; a cowboy, Britt (James Coburn), who joins for the challenge involved; and an on-the-run gunman Lee (Robert Vaughn) in the midst of a crisis of confidence. The group recognizes they will be outnumbered but hope that, when Calvera realizes that the village has hired them, he will move on to a different village.

Arriving at the village, the seven begin to train the villagers how to defend themselves. They all find themselves bonding with the villagers, sharing the meal the women of the village have made them when they discover that the villagers have little food themselves. Chico is fascinated by Petra (Rosenda Monteros), one of the villages young women, while Bernardo begins to bond with three of the villages little boys.   Lee, meanwhile, struggles with nightmares and fears the loss of his skills. Calvera and his bandits soon arrive, sustain heavy losses, and are run out of town by the gunmen and the villagers working in concert. Chico, who is Mexican, follows Calvera back to his camp, pretending to be one of the gang of bandits. There he learns that Calvera still plans to return and raid the village because he is desperate for food to feed his men.

Chico reports this back to Chris and the rest of the men. Though a part of the group believes they should leave, Chris insists that they stay; and they ride out to make a surprise raid on Calveras camp. However, they find the camp empty; on returning to the village, they find that the fearful villagers have allowed Calvera to take control. Calvera spares the gunmens lives, believing they have learned the lesson that the simple farmers are not worth fighting for, and fearing reprisals from the U.S. Army. The seven are escorted out of the village. The group debates their next move, and all but Harry agree to return and free the village from Calvera. Harry believes the effort will lead to their deaths and rides off alone.

A gunfight breaks out, and the villagers, recognizing the courage of the gunmen, soon join in the fight. Bernardo is killed protecting the children he had befriended, and Britt and Lee die after killing a considerable number of bandits. Harry, who had a change of heart, arrives in time to protect Chris but is fatally shot. The bandits are soon routed, and Chris shoots Calvera. Calvera, in his dying breath, asks him, "You came back&nbsp;... to a place like this—why? A man like you—why?"

The three remaining gunmen help to bury their own and the villagers dead. Chico decides to stay in the village with Petra, while Chris and Vin begin to ride out. The village elder bids them farewell and comments that it is only the villagers who have really won: "Youre like the wind, blowing over the land and&nbsp;... passing on&nbsp;... ¡Vaya con Dios!" However, as they leave and pass the graves of their fallen comrades, Chris fatalistically observes: "The Old Man was right. Only the farmers won. We lost. Well always lose."

 Marlboro cigarettes. A similar-sounding (but different) tune was used for Victoria Bitter beer in Australia. The theme was included in the James Bond film Moonraker (film)|Moonraker.
 The Ringer; as entrance music for the British band James (band)|James, as well as episodes of The Simpsons that had a "Western" theme (mainly in the episode titled "Dude, Wheres My Ranch?"). The opening horn riff in Arthur Conleys 1967 hit "Sweet Soul Music" is borrowed from the theme. Canadian band Kon Kan use the opening bars of the theme in their single "I Beg Your Pardon",  Celtic Football Club (Glasgow, Scotland) used the theme music whenever Henrik Larsson scored a goal.
 The Magnificent"; it was released under the group alias One World Orchestra on the charity compilation The Help Album.
 Disneyland Paris. Rivers of the Far West.

The "Main Title" was used as an intro tune on many nights of Bruce Springsteens 2012 Wrecking Ball Tour. The theme was played as the E Street Band entered the stage, adding to the dramatic atmosphere in the stadium.

==Reception== Howard Thompson of The New York Times called the film a "pallid, pretentious and overlong reflection of the Japanese original";  according to Thompson, "dont expect anything like the ice-cold suspense, the superb juxtaposition of revealing human vignettes and especially the pile-driver tempo of the first Seven."    According to Variety (magazine)|Variety magazines December 31, 1960 review, "Until the women and children arrive on the scene about two-thirds of the way through, The Magnificent Seven is a rip-roaring rootin tootin western with lots of bite and tang and old-fashioned abandon. The last third is downhill, a long and cluttered anti-climax in which The Magnificent Seven grow slightly too magnificent for comfort."  Akira Kurosawa, however, was so impressed by the film that he presented John Sturges with a samurai sword.

==Sequels, remakes and adaptations==

===Movies===
The film was a box office disappointment in the United States, but proved to be such a smash hit in Europe that it ultimately went into profit.   Three sequels were eventually made:
*Return of the Seven (1966)
*Guns of the Magnificent Seven (1969)
*The Magnificent Seven Ride (1972)

None of these were as successful as the original film.

The Seven Samurai plotline was revisited once more for 1980 sci-fi film Battle Beyond the Stars. Magnificent Seven actor Robert Vaughn played one of seven mercenaries hired to save a farming planet from alien marauders.

I sette magnifici gladiatori (1983) akaThe Seven Magnificent Gladiators was a Sword-and-sandal variation on the Seven Samurai/Magnificent Seven theme, starring Lou Ferrigno and Sybil Danning (who also appeared in Battle Beyond the Stars).

The 1986 comedy Three Amigos directly parodies many aspects of The Magnificent Seven, from the hiring of a team of Americans to defend a small Mexican village, to the training of the villagers by the mercenaries, to the megalomaniacal over-the-top character of the Mexican gang leader.

Yul Brynner appeared as an unnamed android gunslinger, costumed almost exactly the same as his Magnificent Seven character, in 1973 sc-fi hit Westworld and its 1976 sequel Futureworld.

A remake of the film is currently in the works, with Antoine Fuqua set to direct and Denzel Washington, Chris Pratt and Haley Bennett all signed on to star.  On March 2, 2015, Ethan Hawke was cast, reuniting him with Denzel Washington, his Training Day co-star. 

===Television=== The Magnificent Seven, which ran from 1998 to 2000.  Robert Vaughn was a recurring guest star, a judge who hires the seven to protect the town in which his widowed daughter-in-law and his grandson live.
 pilot film plays much on the plot of The Magnificent Seven, and there are similar plot echoes in various other episodes. James Coburn was originally approached to play John "Hannibal" Smith, the teams leader, a role that ultimately went to George Peppard in the series; and Robert Vaughn was added to the cast in the final season as part of a revamp attempt to boost fading ratings.

===Books===
The plot of Stephen Kings 2003 novel Wolves of the Calla is loosely based on The Magnificent Seven. In the story, gunslinger Roland Deschain and his allies defend a small village from a raiding party that steals children once a generation. The villages name, "Calla Bryn Sturgis", is a nod to Sturges and Brynner, and the similarity in plot leads Rolands allies from 20th century New York to realize that they are taking part in a similar story.  The novel also includes the misquoted epigraph "Mister, we deal in lead."

Robert B. Parkers 2001 novel Potshot (novel)|Potshot borrows heavily from the films end for the final confrontation between Spenser (fictional detective)|Spensers group of seven outlaws and the Dell, the storys antagonists, going so far as to acknowledge it in dialog between characters and having one of them say the line, "We deal in lead, friend."

===Comics=== Star Wars story based on the Seven Samurai/The Magnificent Seven plot.  In the comic, Han and Chewbacca recruit five other aliens from different backgrounds to help defend a city from a band of marauders called the Cloud Riders.
