Jittlov is a special effects technician, and produced all of the special effects in the film himself, many through stop motion animation.

This short film originally was shown as a segment of an episode of The Wonderful World of Disney. The episode was called "Major Effects", and was aired to coincide with the release of Disneys The Black Hole in 1979.

The film segment then began to be shown at science fiction conventions around the country, gaining popularity, prompting Jittlov to eventually create a (semi-)fictionalized account of how this short film came to be, in the form of a feature film.

Years later, Jittlov was able to remake the short, as well as incorporate portions of some of his other short films (such as Time Tripper and Animato), into a feature film|feature-length 35 mm film.
