After a vicious assault by the Sisters nearly kills Andy, Hadley beats Bogs severely. Bogs is sent to another prison and Andy is never attacked again. Warden Samuel Norton meets Andy and reassigns him to the prison library to assist elderly inmate Brooks Hatlen.

In 1965, Tommy Williams is incarcerated for burglary. He joins Andys and Reds circle of friends, and Andy helps him pass his General Educational Development|G.E.D. exam. In 1966, Tommy reveals to Red and Andy that an inmate at another prison claimed responsibility for the murders Andy was convicted of, implying Andys innocence. Andy approaches Warden Norton with this information, but the warden refuses to listen and sends Andy back to solitary when he mentions the money laundering. Norton then has Captain Hadley murder Tommy under the guise of an escape attempt. Andy refuses to continue the money laundering, but relents after Norton threatens to burn the library, remove Andys protection from the guards, and move him out of his cell into worse conditions. Andy is released from solitary confinement after two months and tells Red of his dream of living in Zihuatanejo, a Mexican coastal town. Red feels Andy is being unrealistic, but promises Andy that if he is ever released he will visit a specific hayfield near Buxton, Maine and retrieve a package Andy buried there. Red becomes worried about Andys state of mind, especially when he learns Andy asked another inmate to supply him with six feet of rope.

The next day at roll call the guards find Andys cell empty. An irate Warden Norton throws a rock at the poster of Raquel Welch hanging on the wall, and the rock tears through the poster. Removing the poster, the warden discovers a tunnel that Andy dug with his rock hammer over the previous seventeen years. The previous night, Andy escaped through the tunnel and used the prisons sewage pipe to reach freedom. Andy escapes with Nortons suit, shoes, and the ledger containing details of the money laundering. While guards search for him the following morning, Andy poses as Randall Stephens and visits several banks to withdraw the laundered money. Finally, he mails the ledger and evidence of the corruption and murders at Shawshank to a local newspaper. The police arrive at Shawshank and take Hadley into custody, while Norton commits suicide to avoid arrest.

After serving 40 years, Red is finally paroled. He struggles to adapt to life outside prison and fears he never will. Remembering his promise to Andy, he visits Buxton and finds a cache containing money and a letter asking him to come to Zihuatanejo. Red violates his parole and travels to Fort Hancock, Texas to cross the border to Mexico, admitting he finally feels hope. On a beach in Zihuatanejo he finds Andy, and the two friends are happily reunited.

==Cast==
*  , respectively.
* Morgan Freeman as Ellis Boyd "Red" Redding, Andys best friend and the films narrator; convicted of murder in 1927. Before Freeman was cast, Clint Eastwood, Harrison Ford, Paul Newman, and Robert Redford were each considered for the role. Although written as a middle-aged Irishman with greying red hair (as in the novella), Darabont cast Freeman for his authoritative presence and demeanor; he could not see anyone else as Red. Audio commentary with director and writer Frank Darabont  The short dialogue with Andy is a jest towards this casting decision, as when asked about the origin of his nickname, Red ironically replies, "Maybe its because Im Irish."  Freeman once stated in an interview that Rita Hayworth and the Shawshank Redemption is his favorite book. 
* Bob Gunton as Warden Samuel Norton. Although he is well versed in the Bible and presents himself as a pious, devout Christian and reform-minded administrator, his actions reveal him to be corrupt, ruthless, and remorseless. William Sadler as Heywood, a member of Reds gang of long-serving convicts.
* Clancy Brown as Capt. Byron Hadley, chief of the guards. Hadley is a sadistic guard who thinks nothing of delivering beatings to the inmates to keep them in line. When cast for the role, Brown declined the offer to study real-life prison guards as preparation for his role, because he felt that he would end up with too many inspirations to balance. 
* Gil Bellows as Tommy Williams, a young convict whose experiences in a previous prison hold the truth about Andys innocence. prison rapist.
* James Whitmore as Brooks Hatlen, prison librarian/trustee and one of the oldest convicts at Shawshank, having been in prison since 1905. Darabont cast Whitmore because he was one of his favorite character actors. 
* Jeffrey DeMunn as the prosecuting attorney in Andy Dufresnes trial.

==Themes==
Chicago Sun-Times film reviewer Roger Ebert suggested that The Shawshank Redemption is an allegory for maintaining ones feeling of self-worth when placed in a hopeless position. Andy Dufresnes integrity is an important theme in the story line, especially in prison, where integrity is lacking. 

Isaac M. Morehouse suggests that the film provides a great illustration of how characters can be free, even in prison, or unfree, even in freedom, based on ones outlook on life.   
 

==Production== Dollar Deals The Green The Mist.
 The Body, Stand by Me (1986), offered $2.5 million in an attempt to write and direct Shawshank. He planned to cast Tom Cruise in the part of Andy and Harrison Ford as Red. Darabont seriously considered and liked Reiners vision, but he ultimately decided it was his "chance to do something really great" by directing the film himself. 
 , also known as the Mansfield Reformatory, served as the fictional Shawshank Prison]] Air Force One.    Several of the interior shots of the specialized prison facilities, such as the admittance rooms and the wardens office, were shot in the reformatory.  The interior of the boarding room used by Brooks and Red was located in the administration building, though exterior shots were made elsewhere.  The prison site is a tourist attraction.   Internal scenes in the prison cellblocks were actually filmed on a soundstage built inside the nearby shuttered Westinghouse factory.  Downtown scenes were also filmed in Mansfield, as well as neighboring Ashland, Ohio. The oak tree under which Andy buries his letter to Red is located at  , near Malabar Farm State Park, in Lucas, Ohio. The tree was heavily damaged by straight-line winds in a thunderstorm on July 29, 2011; officials were unsure if the tree would survive.  However, thanks to rally groups and inspections by forestry organizations, the tree was found to be alive and well and still stands to this day. 

Just as a prison in Ohio stood in for a fictional one in Maine, the beach scenes shown in the final minutes of the film that were meant to portray Zihuatanejo, Mexico were actually shot in the Caribbean on the island of St.Croix, one of the U.S. Virgin Islands. The beach at ‘Zihuatanejo’ is Sandy Point National Wildlife Refuge, a two-mile crescent of sand just south of Frederiksted on the southwestern tip of the island. The refuge is a hatching ground for leatherback turtles, and open only at limited times (10am to 4pm on Saturdays and Sundays), and not at all during the breeding season. 

The beach at Zihuatanejo made famous by the film has recently been closed to the public due to a health warning as a result of high levels of pollution in the water. 

The film was dedicated to Allen Greene, an agent and a close personal friend of the films director, Frank Darabont. Greene died shortly before the film was released due to complications of HIV/AIDS.

The film has been critically acclaimed for depicting Jean-Paul Sartre|Jean-Paul Sartres ideas about existentialism more fully than any other contemporary movie. 

Entertainment Weekly reviewer Owen Gleiberman praised the choice of scenery, writing that the "moss-dark, saturated images have a redolent sensuality" that makes the film very realistic.    While praising Morgan Freemans acting and oratory skills as making Red appear real, Gleiberman felt that with the "laconic-good-guy, neo-Gary Cooper role, Tim Robbins is unable to make Andy connect with the audience."

===Home media===
Despite its disappointing box office return, Warner Bros. shipped 320,000 rental video copies throughout the United States, and it became one of the top rented films of 1995. The films home viewing success was considered to be based on positive recommendations and repeat customers.  cable TV viewings.  In June 1997, TNT (TV channel)|TNT, an American cable network, showed the film for the first time. The film was the first feature in TNTs Saturday Night New Classics. A 2004 Sunday Times article suggested that TNT aired the film frequently from then on, about once every two months.  TV airings of the film accrued record breaking numbers. 

== Music ==
 

The score was composed by Thomas Newman and was nominated for an Academy Award for Best Original Score in 1994, which was his first Oscar nomination.  Much of the score consists of faint piano music, and pizzicato strings during the more active or humorous moments.  The scores two main themes only occur two or three times.  The prison theme, first heard in the beginning, is a four note ascending line in the bass, which is developed and reaches its climax when Andy is standing in the river in the rain. The second theme represents freedom, and is first heard when the inmates are sharing beer, feeling like free men. This theme doesnt reoccur until the final credits, this time grander, with fuller orchestration.  Like Hans Zimmers score to the "Thin Red Line", the track is often played in trailers during their most dramatic moments.  Zimmer himself has credited the score as the one "that has influenced everything the most" and that Newman opened up the harmonic palette of film scores. A central scene in the film features the "Letter Duet" ("Canzonetta sullaria") from Wolfgang Amadeus Mozart|Mozarts The Marriage of Figaro Act 3 , K. 492, also known in Italian as "Sullaria...che soave zeffiretto," meaning a duettino, or a short duet. In the duettino, Countess Almaviva (a soprano) dictates to Susanna (also a soprano) the invitation to a tryst addressed to the countess husband in a plot to expose his infidelity.

Ellis Boyd "Red" Redding (Morgan Freeman) remarks in his voice-over narration: "I have no idea to this day what those two Italian ladies were singing about.   Id like to think they were singing about something so beautiful it cant be expressed in words, and it makes your heart ache because of it." The music highlights the irony in the movie as the opera characters are singing about a duplicitous love letter to expose infidelity.
