==Reception==

===Critical response===
When first released, the staff at Variety (magazine)|Variety magazine gave the film a positive review, writing, "Crossfire is a frank spotlight on anti-Semitism. Producer Dore Schary, in association with Adrian Scott, has pulled no punches. There is no skirting such relative fol-de-rol as intermarriage or clubs that exclude Jews. Here is a hard-hitting film   whose whodunit aspects are fundamentally incidental to the overall thesis of bigotry and race prejudice...Director Edward Dmytryk has drawn gripping portraitures. The flashback technique is effective as it shades and colors the sundry attitudes of the heavy, as seen or recalled by the rest of the cast." 

The New York Times film critic, Bosley Crowther, lauded the acting in the drama, and wrote, "Mr. Dmytryk has handled most excellently a superlative cast which plays the drama. Robert Ryan is frighteningly real as the hard, sinewy, loud-mouthed, intolerant and vicious murderer, and Robert Mitchum, Steve Brodie and George Cooper are variously revealing as his pals. Robert Young gives a fine taut performance as the patiently questing D. A., whose mind and sensibilities are revolted—and eloquently expressed—by what he finds. Sam Levene is affectingly gentle in his brief bit as the Jewish victim, and Gloria Grahame is believably brazen and pathetic as a girl of the streets." 

Critic Dennis Schwartz questioned the noir aspects of the film and discussed the cinematography in his review.  He wrote, "This is more of a message film than a noir thriller, but has been classified by most cinephiles in the noir category...J. Roy Hunt, the 70-year-old cinematographer, who goes back to the earliest days of Hollywood, shot the film using the style of low-key lighting, providing dark shots of Monty, contrasted with ghost-like shots of Mary Mitchell (Jacqueline) as she angelically goes to help her troubled husband Arthur." 

The review aggregator Rotten Tomatoes reported that 83% of critics gave the film a positive review, based on twelve reviews." 

The film made a profit of $1,270,000. Richard Jewell & Vernon Harbin, The RKO Story. New Rochelle, New York: Arlington House, 1982. p. 222

==Difference from the novel==
Richard Brooks wrote his novel while he was a sergeant in the U.S. Marine Corps making training films at Marine Corps Base Quantico|Quantico, Virginia and Camp Pendleton, California. In the novel, the victim was homosexuality|homosexual.  As told in the film The Celluloid Closet and in the documentary included on the DVD edition of the Crossfire film, the Hollywood Hays Code prohibited any mention of homosexuality because it was seen as a sexual perversion. Hence, the books theme of homophobia was changed to one about racism and antisemitism. The book was published while Brooks was serving in the Marine Corps.  A fellow Marine by the name of Robert Ryan met Brooks and told him he was determined to play in a version of the book on screen.
