==Plot==
Dr. Malcolm Crowe, a child psychologist living in Philadelphia, returns to his home with his wife, Anna Crowe, after having been honored for his work.  Anna tells Malcolm that everything is second to his work.  Their private moment is interrupted when an obviously agitated young man appears in their bathroom, accusing Malcolm of failing him.  Malcolm recognizes him as Vincent Grey, a former patient whom he treated as a child for severe hallucinations. Vincent shoots Malcolm before killing himself.

The next fall, Malcolm begins working with another patient, 9-year-old Cole Sear, whose case is similar to Vincents. Malcolm becomes dedicated to the boy, though he is haunted by doubts over his ability to help him after his failure with Vincent. Meanwhile, his wife hardly pays any attention to him.  Cole eventually confides his secret to Malcolm: he sees dead people, who walk around like the living unaware they are dead.
 poisoning her, revealing the true reason she died and saving Kyras younger sister who had become the mothers new victim.

Learning to live with the ghosts he sees, Cole starts to fit in at school, even securing the lead in the school play, which Malcolm attends. The doctor and patient depart on good terms, and Cole suggests to Malcolm that he should try speaking to Anna while she is asleep. Later, while stuck in a traffic jam, Cole confesses his secret to his mother, Lynn, telling that someone died in an accident up ahead and explaining that he knows because the person is right next to him (the victim, a woman cyclist showing signs of the trauma of the accident, is shown next to Cole in one shot, but is invisible in another which favors his mothers perspective).  Although Lynn is at first distraught by the apparent signs of mental illness in her son, Cole proves his ability to her by talking about how his grandmother visits him. Lynn becomes even more concerned by Coles comments, but by discussing emotional details about the past relationship between his mother and grandmother (details that neither he nor anyone else could know of, aside from Lynn), he is able to convince her of the truth, and she tearfully embraces him.

Malcolm returns home, where he finds his wife asleep with their wedding video playing. Still asleep, Anna asks Malcolm why he left her, and then drops Malcolms wedding ring; looking at his hand, Malcolm finds the ring missing, though it has been present in past scenes. He remembers what Cole said about ghosts not realizing that they are dead and comes to understand that he was actually killed by Vincent that night, and was unknowingly dead the entire time he was working with Cole. Because of Coles efforts, Malcolms unfinished business – rectifying his failure to understand and help Vincent – is finally complete.  Having only one unfinished piece of business, he bids an emotional farewell to his wife, telling her she was never second, and that he loves her.  Realizing that, far from being emotionally distant from him, his wife has not been able to move on from his death. He tells her to sleep well and that "everything will be different in the morning"; the camera pans to the wedding video and the shot fades out with the implication that Malcolm, now at peace, has moved on from the world of the living.

==Production== The Walt Disney Studios, read Shyamalans speculative script and instantly loved it. Without obtaining corporate approval, Vogel bought the rights to the script, despite the high price of $3 million and the stipulation that Shyamalan could direct the film.  Disney later dismissed Vogel from his position at the studio, with Vogel leaving the company shortly thereafter.  Disney—apparently in a show of little confidence in the film—sold the production rights to Spyglass Entertainment, while retaining the distribution rights and 12.5% of the films box office receipt.

The color red is intentionally absent from most of the film, but is used prominently in a few isolated shots for "anything in the real world that has been tainted by the other world"  and "to connote really explosively emotional moments and situations".  Examples include the door of the church where Cole seeks sanctuary; the balloon, carpet, and Coles sweater at the birthday party; the tent in which he first encounters Kyra; the volume numbers on Crowes tape recorder; the doorknob on the locked basement door where Malcolms office is located; the shirt that Anna wears at the restaurant; Kyras step-mothers dress at the wake; and the shawl wrapped around the sleeping Anna.

All of the clothes Malcolm wears during the film are items he wore or touched the evening before his death, which included his overcoat, his blue rowing sweatshirt and the different layers of his suit. Though the filmmakers were careful about clues of Malcolms true state, the camera zooms slowly towards his face when Cole says, "I see dead people." In a special feature, the filmmakers mention they initially feared this would be too much of a giveaway, but decided to leave it in.
