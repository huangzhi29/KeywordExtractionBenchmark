==Plot==
  thermite charge, destroying the helicopter. The surviving Norwegian pursues the dog, firing a rifle, until he is killed by Garry, the station commander. The Americans send a helicopter pilot, MacReady, and Dr. Copper to the Norwegian camp for answers, but they find only a charred ruin. Outside, they discover the burned remains of a humanoid corpse with two faces, which they bring back along with some video footage. Their biologist, Blair, performs an autopsy on the corpse, finding a normal set of human internal organs.

Clark kennels the Malamute with the stations sled dogs, where it metamorphoses and attacks the other dogs. When he hears the commotion, MacReady pulls the fire alarm, and Childs incinerates the creature with a flamethrower.  Blair performs another autopsy which leads him to believe the creature perfectly imitates other life forms. The Norwegians records lead the Americans to a buried flying saucer that the stations geologist, Norris, hypothesizes is likely over 100,000 years old. Blair becomes increasingly suspicious of the others and withdraws, calculating that if the alien escapes to a civilized area, all life on Earth will be assimilated in a few years. Fuchs tells MacReady that he is worried about Blair, and according to Blairs journal, the creatures "dead" remains are still active on a cellular level. The camp enacts safety measures designed to reduce risk of infection.

The creature assimilates Bennings, but Windows catches him outside before his metamorphosis is complete and MacReady burns the creature before it can escape. They discover Blair has wrecked all the transports and killed the remaining sled dogs.  The team corners Blair as he is destroying the radio and locks him in an isolated tool shed. Copper recommends a blood-serum test to determine who is infected, but the paranoid men turn on each other when they find the blood stores have been sabotaged.

MacReady takes charge and orders Fuchs to continue Blairs work, but Fuchs disappears; MacReady, Windows, and Nauls find his burned body outside. Windows returns to warn the others while MacReady and Nauls investigate further. On the way back, Nauls cuts MacReady loose from the tow line.  He assumes that MacReady has been assimilated when he finds a torn shirt with MacReadys name on it. As the team debates MacReadys fate, he breaks in and threatens to destroy the station with a bundle of dynamite if they attack him. Norris appears to suffer a heart attack after he and Nauls unsuccessfully attack MacReady from behind.

When Copper attempts to revive him, Norris transforms and kills Copper. MacReady incinerates the creature and orders Windows to tie up everyone for a new test.  Clark attacks MacReady, and MacReady kills him.  MacReady explains his theory that every piece of the alien is an individual organism with its own survival instinct. One by one, MacReady tests everyones blood with a heated piece of copper wire.  Everyone is still human except Palmer, whose blood flees from the wire. Exposed, Palmer metamorphoses and attacks Windows, forcing MacReady to burn them both.

Leaving Childs on guard, the others head out to test Blair, only to find that he has tunneled out of the tool shed. They realize that Blair is infected and has been scavenging equipment to build a small escape craft. Discovering that Childs is missing and the stations power generator is destroyed, MacReady speculates that the Thing now intends to freeze itself until a rescue team arrives. MacReady, Garry, and Nauls decide to dynamite the complex, hoping to destroy the Thing.  While setting the explosives, Garry is killed and Nauls disappears. As MacReady rushes to set the charges, a larger monster emerges from below and destroys the detonator.  MacReady triggers the blast with a stick of dynamite, and the base explodes.

MacReady sits as the camp burns, and Childs reappears. Childs claims he was lost in the storm while pursuing Blair. Exhausted and with virtually no hope of survival, they acknowledge the futility of their distrust, sharing a bottle of scotch as the camp burns.

==Production== Stewart in northern British Columbia. The research station in the film was built by the film crew during summer, and the film shot in sub-freezing winter conditions. The only female presence in the film is the voice of a chess computer, voiced by Carpenter regular (and then-wife) Adrienne Barbeau, as well as the female contestants viewed on a videotaped episode of Lets Make a Deal.

According to the sign post outside the camp, the Antarctic research team is stationed at the United States National Science Institute Station 4.  However, in early drafts of the script, the base was called, "U.S. Outpost 31".

The Thing was Carpenters eighth time directing a full-length feature and his first film under the production of a major film studio (Universal Studios).

The Thing was the fourth film shot by cinematographer   and Escape from L.A.. Most of the special creature effects were designed and created by Rob Bottin and his crew, with the exception of the dog creature, which was created by Stan Winston.  Winston was brought in when Bottins team found themselves overloaded with work on the other creatures seen in the film.

 nihilistic conclusion. The alternate ending with MacReady definitively proven to be human has yet to be released.

According to the 1998 DVD release, the "Blair Monster" was to have had a much larger role in the final battle. However, due to the limitations of stop-motion animation, the monster appears for only a few seconds in the film.

One of the films associate producers, Larry J. Franco, has a credited cameo as the Norwegian rifleman from the beginning of the film. Director John Carpenter and his then-wife Adrienne Barbeau have uncredited cameos as a man in the Norwegian video footage and the voice of the chess computer, respectively.

Two names were changed from Bill Lancasters second draft of the script.   The character Windows was originally named Sanchez, who was described as "hating it here" and "lousy at his job". The second character changed is the Norwegian rifleman, who was identified as "Jans Bolan" in a deleted scene from his dogtags and named Lars according to the 2011 prequel.

The films musical score was composed by Ennio Morricone, a rare instance of Carpenter not scoring one of his own films,  although Carpenter did score a few pieces of music with Alan Howarth which were also used in the final film.  In 2012, Morricone recalled,

 

==Release== TBS and Universal Studios. The edited version was heavily cut to reduce gore, violence, and profanity; additionally it featured a narrator during the opening sequence (in the same manner as the original 1951 film), a voiceover during Blairs computer-assisted study, and an alternate ending. In the alternate ending, the "Thing", which has once again mimicked one of the sled dogs, looks back at the burning camp at dawn before continuing on into the Antarctic wilderness. 

The Thing has subsequently been released twice on   transfer was not included, but this omission was remedied with the second DVD/HD DVD release in October 2004, which featured identical supplements to the 1998 release, with the exception of the isolated score track from the documentary. The film was released on Blu-ray Disc in Europe on October 6, 2008.

Unlike the American version of The Thing released on Blu-ray, the European version features most of the extras from the 1998 and 2005 DVD releases. These extras include the documentary The Thing: Terror Takes Shape although several extras, most notably the alternate ending, were not included. The Blu-ray version also includes various Blu-ray only features, such as a HD version of the film (although the extras are still presented in 480i/p, depending on the extra) as well as a picture-in-picture mode that pops up at various points of the film. Although the feature is new, the footage included in the picture-in-picture mode are all taken from "The Thing: Terror Takes Shape" documentary. The Blu-ray versions of The Thing are Region Free, making any version playable in any BD player.

===Box office===
The Thing opened #8 and remained in the top 10 at the box office for three weeks.  The film was released in the United States on June 25, 1982 in 840 theaters and was issued an "R" rating by the Motion Picture Association of America.  The film cost $15,000,000 to produce, and debuted at #8 at the box office, with an opening weekend gross of $3.1 million. It went on to make $19,629,760 domestically.    Carpenter and other writers have speculated that the films poor performance was due to the release of E.T. the Extra-Terrestrial two weeks earlier, with its more optimistic scenario of alien visitation (which received a "PG" rating from the MPAA). The Thing also opened on the same day as Ridley Scotts science fiction film Blade Runner, which debuted at #2. 

==Reception==
{{Quote box quote = "I take every failure hard. The one I took the hardest was The Thing. My career would have been different if that had been a big hit...The movie was hated.

Even the original movies director, Christian Nyby, was dissing me." source = —John Carpenter on the reception of The Thing  width = 40% bgcolor =

The film received mixed reviews upon release. The films groundbreaking makeup special effects were simultaneously lauded and lambasted for being technically brilliant but visually repulsive and excessive. Film critic Roger Ebert called the film "disappointing", though said he found it scary and that it was "a great Airsickness bag|barf-bag movie." However, he criticized what he felt were poor characterizations and illogical plot elements, ultimately giving the film 2½ stars out of 4.  In his review for The New York Times, Vincent Canby called it "a foolish, depressing, overproduced movie that mixes horror with science fiction to make something that is fun as neither one thing or the other. Sometimes it looks as if it aspired to be the quintessential moron movie of the 80s."  Time (magazine)|Time magazines Richard Schickel wrote, "Designer Rob Bottins work is novel and unforgettable, but since it exists in a near vacuum emotionally, it becomes too domineering dramatically and something of an exercise in abstract art." 
 New York magazine wrote that the original story may have influenced Invasion of the Body Snatchers and Alien (film)|Alien, but a new adaptation seems derivative. 

Despite mixed contemporary reviews, the film has been reappraised substantially in the years following its release, and now maintains an 80% "Certified Fresh" rating on  s 100 Scariest Movie Moments.  Similarly, the Chicago Film Critics Association named it the 17th scariest film ever made.  The Thing was named "the scariest movie . . . ever!" by the staff of the Boston Globe.  In 2008, the film was selected by Empire Magazine|Empire magazine as one of The 500 Greatest Movies of All Time.   John Kenneth Muir, writing in Horror Movies of the 1980s, called it "Carpenters most accomplished and underrated directorial effort".  Muir goes on to say that it is "the best science fiction-horror film of 1982, an incredibly competitive year, and perhaps even the best genre motion picture of the decade". 

In 2011, The New York Times asked prominent horror filmmakers what film they had found the scariest. Two, John Sayles and Edgar Wright, cited The Thing. "The theater was full, and I had to sit in the front row," Sayles recalled.

Though they did not speak a common language, Carpenter and Morricone collaborated on the soundtrack.  Carpenter said that he urged Morricone toward a more minimalist direction.   MCA released the soundtrack in 1982 and 1985; Varèse Sarabande released it 1991 on compact disc.  It was also available as an isolated score track on the 1998 DVD release, but is not present on the 2005 edition. The soundtrack has since gone out of print. A re-recording of the soundtrack, produced and arranged by Alan Howarth and Larry Hopkins, is currently available. It is the only version of the soundtrack that contains the unused Carpenter and Howarth pieces.

==Legacy==

===Sequels and prequel=== Sci Fi Channel planned to do a four-hour mini-series sequel to the film in 2003. Carpenter stated that he believed the project should proceed, but the Sci Fi Channel later removed all mention of the project from their homepage. In February 2009, a positive review of the abandoned screenplay for the Sci-Fi miniseries was published on Coronas Coming Attractions. 

In 2004, John Carpenter said in an Empire (magazine)|Empire magazine interview that he has a story idea for The Thing II, which centers around the two surviving characters, MacReady and Childs. However, Carpenter felt that due to the higher price associated with his fee, Universal Studios will not pursue his storyline. Carpenter indicated that he would be able to secure both Kurt Russell and Keith David for the sequel. In his story, Carpenter would explain the age difference of the actors between the two installments by having frostbite on their face due to the elements until rescued. The assumption of the sequel would rely on a radio signal being successfully transmitted by Windows before Blair destroyed the communications room. Thus, after the explosion of the base camp, the rescue team would arrive and find MacReady and Childs still alive. Carpenter has not disclosed any other details. 
 Dawn of The Thing and was filmed in 2010.  In the prequel, the Norwegian crew discovers the alien three days prior to the dog-thing arriving at Outpost 31. Surviving characters of the prequel, Matias and Lars, become the two Norwegians chasing the dog by helicopter in the opening of the 1982 film.  The 2011 film was directed by Matthijs van Heijningen Jr., shot in Toronto, and released on October 14 of that year. 

===Theme parks===
In 2007, the Halloween Horror Nights event at Universal Studios in Orlando, Florida, the film property was designed as a haunted attraction called The Thing - Assimilation.  Guests walked through Outpost 3113, a military facility where the remains of Outpost 31 were brought for scientific research. Scenes and props from the film were recreated for the attraction, including the bodies of MacReady and Childs. In 2009, the events icon house, Silver Screams, contained a room based on the film.

Universal Studios also featured Haunted Attractions based on The Things 2011 prequel at both the Florida and Hollywood editions of Halloween Horror Nights in 2011. 

===Books and comics===
 
  1982 by Alan Dean Foster. Although the novel is generally true to the film, there are minor differences: the Windows character is named Sanders, and an episode in which MacReady, Bennings and Childs chase after several infected dogs which escape into the Antarctic wastes was added (this sequence was featured in Lancasters second draft of the screenplay). The disappearance of Nauls is also explained in the novel; pursued by Blair-Thing into a dead end, he kills himself rather than allow it to assimilate him.

  Fantastic Four member, the Thing (comics)|Thing.  Much later, Dark Horse released a digital comic called The Thing: The Northman Nightmare as a prelude to the films 2011 prequel. 
 Peter Watts nomination to the Hugo Award in 2011. 

===Video games===
In 2002,  , offered a free copy of the 1998 DVD release as an incentive for reserving the game.    In 2011, a region of the Entropia Universe was created based on the theme of The Thing. 

The story follows on where the film left off: Childs is found dead and frozen where he was last seen at the end of the film, but at the end of the game it is revealed that R.J. MacReady survived as he evacuates the games main character in a helicopter.

===Action figures===
In September 2000, as part of the third series of its "Movie Maniacs" line of toys, McFarlane Toys released two figures based on the film. One was the Blair Monster  seen near the ending of the film, and the other is the Norris Creature seen during the defibrillator scene. The latter included a smaller figurine of the disembodied head with spider legs also seen in the film. Sota Toys also released a bust of the spider head, as well as a box set of the kennel scene showing the Thing imitating the dogs. 

===Annual viewings=== The Shining.  It is also viewed by scientific personnel at the Summit Camp on the apex of the Greenland Ice Sheet.
