== Plot ==
In 1977, Harry Burns (Crystal) and Sally Albright (Ryan) graduate from the University of Chicago and share the drive to New York City, where Sally is beginning Journalism school and Harry is starting a career; at the time, Harry is dating a friend of Sallys, Amanda (Nicastro).

During the drive, they discuss their differing ideas about relationships between men and women. Harry says that "Men and women cant be friends because the sex part always gets in the way". Sally disagrees, claiming that men and women can be strictly friends without sex. During a stop in a diner, Sally is angered when Harry tells her she is attractive; she accuses him of making a pass at her. In New York, because of their divergent philosophies, they part on unfriendly terms.

Five years later, they meet in a New York airport and find themselves on the same plane. Both are in relationships; Sally has just started dating a man named Joe (Ford) — who is a neighbor of Harrys — and Harry is engaged to a woman named Helen, which surprises Sally. Harry suggests they become friends, forcing him to elaborate on his previous rule about the impossibility of male-female friendships. Despite Harrys suggestions of exceptions to that rule, they eventually separate, concluding that they will not be friends.

Harry and Sally run into each other again five years later, in a New York bookstore. They have coffee and talk about their previous relationships, both of which have ended, with Sally and Joe breaking up because she realized she wanted a family and he didnt want to get married, and Harrys because Helen fell in love with another man. After leaving the café, they take a walk and decide to be friends. In subsequent scenes, they have late-night phone conversations, go to dinner, and spend a lot of time together. Their dating experiences with others continue to highlight their different approaches to relationships and sex.
 wedding dinner. Following this fight, Harry repeatedly attempts to mend his friendship with Sally, but she feels that they cannot be friends after what happened.
 New Years Eve party that year, Sally feels alone without Harry by her side. Meanwhile, Harry is shown spending New Years alone as he walks around the city. As she decides to leave the party early, Harry appears and declares his love for her; and at first she argues that the only reason he is there because she is lonely, but he disagrees and lists the many things he realized he loves about her, and they make up and kiss, and in a short closing scene after that shows them being interviewed together, and they say that they had gotten married three months later after that night.

In 1984, director Rob Reiner, producer Andy Scheinman and writer Nora Ephron met over lunch at the Russian Tea Room in New York City to develop a project. {{cite news

Ephron liked the idea, and Reiner acquired a deal at a studio.

}}  The comedian "experienced vicariously" Reiners (his best friend at the time) return to single life after divorcing comedienne/filmmaker Penny Marshall and in the process was unconsciously doing research for the role of Harry. 

During the screenwriting process when Ephron would not feel like writing, she would interview people who worked for the production company. Some of the interviews appeared in the film as the interludes between certain scenes featuring couples talking about how they met,  although the material was rewritten and reshot with actors. Ephron supplied the structure of the film with much of the dialogue based on the real-life friendship between Reiner and Crystal. {{cite news

}}  For example, in the scene where Sally and Harry appear on a split screen, talking on the telephone while watching their respective television sets, channel surfing, was something that Crystal and Reiner did every night. 

Originally, Ephron wanted to call the film How They Met and went through several different titles. Reiner even started a contest with the crew during principal photography - whoever came up with the title won a case of champagne.  In order to get into the lonely mindset of Harry when he was divorced and single, Crystal stayed by himself in a separate room from the cast and crew while they were shooting in Manhattan.  The script initially ended with Harry and Sally remaining friends and not pursuing a romantic relationship because she felt that was "the true ending", as did Reiner.  Eventually, Ephron and Reiner realized that it would be a more appropriate ending for them to marry, though they admit that this is generally not a realistic outcome. {{cite news

When posed the films central question, can men and women just be friends, Ryan replied, "Yes, men and women can just be friends. I have a lot of platonic (male) friends, and sex doesnt get in the way." Crystal said, "Im a little more optimistic than Harry. But I think it is difficult. Men basically act like stray dogs in front of a supermarket. I do have platonic (women) friends, but not best, best, best friends." {{cite news

=== Deli scene ===
 
 
In a scene featuring the two title characters having lunch at   referred to her as the woman "who delivered one of the most memorably funny lines in movie history".  This scene was shot again and again, and Ryan demonstrated her fake orgasms for hours.  Katzs Deli still hangs a sign above the table that says, "Where Harry met Sally... hope you have what she had!"  

This classic scene was born when the film started to focus too much on Harry. Crystal remembers saying, "We need something for Sally to talk about, and Nora said, Well, faking orgasm is a great one, and right away we said, Well, the subject is good, and then Meg came on board and we talked with her about the nature of the idea and she said, Well, why dont I just fake one, just do one?"  Ryan suggested that the scene take place in a restaurant,  and it was Crystal who came up with the scenes classic punchline – "Ill have what shes having."  In 2005, the quote was listed 33rd on the AFIs 100 Years... 100 Movie Quotes list of memorable movie lines. Reiner recalls that at a test screening, all of the women in the audience were laughing while all of the men were silent. 

In fall 2013, Improv Everywhere, the New York City initiative behind the annual No Pants Day in the subways and various flash-mob stunts, convened and filmed a re-enactment. While a look-alike couple performed the scene, 30 others joined as if it was contagious. Surprised staff and customers responded in appreciation. The film and follow-up interviews are public.
