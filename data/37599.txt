==Plot==

===Mexico storyline===
In Mexico, police officer Javier Rodriguez (del Toro) and his partner Manolo Sanchez (Vargas) stop a drug transport and arrest the couriers. Their arrest is interrupted by General Salazar (Milian), a high-ranking Mexican official who decides to hire Javier. Salazar instructs him to apprehend Francisco Flores (Collins), a hitman for the Tijuana Cartel, headed by the Obregón brothers.

Back in Tijuana, Flores, under torture, gives Salazar the names of important members of the Obregón cartel, who are arrested. Javier and Salazars efforts begin to cripple the Obregón brothers cocaine outfit, but Javier soon discovers Salazar is a pawn for the Juárez Cartel, the rival of the Obregón brothers. That entire portion of the Mexican anti-drug campaign is a fraud, as Salazar is wiping out one cartel because he has aligned with another for profit.

Javiers partner Sanchez attempts to sell the information of Salazars true affiliation to the DEA but is killed for his betrayal. Javier, who can no longer stomach working for Salazar, decides to make a deal with the DEA. In exchange for his testimony, Javier requests electricity in his neighborhood so the kids can play baseball at night rather than be tempted by street gangs and crime. Salazars secrets are revealed to the public and he is arrested and dies in prison.

Javier explains to the media about the widespread corruption in the police force and army. In Mexico, Javier watches as children play baseball at night in their new stadium.

===Wakefield storyline===
Meanwhile, Robert Wakefield (Douglas), a conservative Ohio judge, is appointed to head the President of the United States|Presidents Office of National Drug Control Policy, taking on the title drug czar. Robert is warned by his predecessor (Brolin) and several influential politicians that the War on Drugs is unwinnable. His daughter, Caroline (Christensen), an honors student, has been using cocaine, methamphetamine and heroin which gradually develops into a drug addiction after her boyfriend Seth (Grace) introduces her to free-basing heroin. Caroline and Seth are arrested when a fellow student overdoses on drugs at a party. As Robert and his wife Barbara (Irving) struggle to deal with the problem, he discovers that she has known about their daughters involvement with drugs for over six months.

Robert realizes his daughter Caroline is a drug addict and is caught between his demanding new position and difficult family life. On a visit to Mexico, he is encouraged by the successful efforts of Salazar in hurting the Obregón brothers. When he returns to Ohio, Robert learns his efforts to see Caroline rehabilitated have failed. She ran away to the city of Cincinnati, where no one knows her location. She steals from her parents to procure money for drugs. Her addiction leaves her vulnerable, and she quickly becomes the victim of human trafficking.

Robert drags Seth along as he begins to search Cincinnati for his daughter. After a drug dealer who is prostituting Caroline refuses to reveal her whereabouts, Robert breaks into a seedy hotel room and finds a semi-conscious Caroline in the company of an older man. He breaks down in tears as Seth quietly leaves. Robert returns to Washington, D.C., to give his prepared speech on a "10-point plan" to win the war on drugs. In the middle of the speech, he falters, then tells the press that the War on Drugs implies a war even on some peoples own family members, which he cannot endorse. He then walks out of the press conference and takes a taxi to the airport. Robert and Barbara go to Narcotics Anonymous meetings with their daughter to support her and others.

===Ayala/DEA storyline===
A third story is set in   Carlos Ayala (Bauer), the biggest distributor for the Obregón brothers in the United States. Ayala is indicted by a tough prosecutor, hand-selected by Robert to send a message to the Mexican drug organizations.

As the trial against Carlos Ayala begins, his pregnant wife Helena (Zeta-Jones) learns of her husbands true profession. Facing the prospect of life imprisonment for her husband and death threats against her only child, Helena decides to hire Flores to assassinate Eduardo Ruiz; she knows killing Ruiz will effectively end the trial nolle prosequi. Flores plants a car bomb on a DEA car in an assassination attempt against Ruiz. Shortly after planting the bomb, Flores is assassinated by a sniper in retaliation for his co-operation with General Salazar; the car bomb kills Castro, but Gordon and Ruiz survive.

Helena, knowing Ruiz is soon scheduled to testify, makes a deal with Juan Obregón (Bratt), lord of the drug cartel, who forgives the debt of the Ayala family and has Ruiz poisoned. Ayala is released, much to the dissatisfaction of Gordon, who is still angry over the death of his partner. Soon after the release, Gordon bursts into the Ayala home and surreptitiously plants a listening bug under his desk and leaves, smiling.

==Development== Palisades High School doing drugs and getting involved with gangs.    Soderbergh approached Gaghan to work on his film, but found he was already working for producer/director Edward Zwick. Bickford and Soderbergh approached Zwick, who agreed to merge the two projects and come aboard as a producer. 
 USA Films, however, had wanted to take on the movie from the first time Soderbergh approached them.  They provided the filmmakers with a $46 million budget, a considerable increase from the $25 million which Fox offered. 

===Screenplay=== Erin Brockovich.  After Soderbergh was finished with that film, Gaghan had written a first draft in six weeks that was 165 pages long.  After the film was approved for production, Soderbergh and Gaghan met two separate times for three days to reformat the script.  The draft they shot with had 163 pages with 135 speaking parts and featured seven cities.  The film shortens the storyline of the original mini-series; a major character arc, that of a farmer, is taken out, and the Pakistani plotline is replaced with one set in Mexico. 

===Casting===
Harrison Ford was initially considered for the role of Robert Wakefield in January 2000, but would have had to take a significant cut in his usual $20 million salary.  Ford met with Soderbergh to flesh out the character. Gaghan agreed to rework the role, adding several scenes that ended up in the finished film. On February 20, Ford turned down the role and the filmmakers brought it back to Michael Douglas, who had turned down an earlier draft. He liked the changes made and agreed to star, which helped greenlight the project.  Gaghan believes Ford turned down the role because he wanted to "reconnect with his action fans." 
 Democrat and Republican Party (United States)|Republican, asking them to make cameo appearances in the film. Several of the scenes had already been shot using actors in these roles, but the filmmakers went back and re-shot those scenes when real politicians agreed to be in the film.  Those who agreed, including U.S. Senators Harry Reid, Barbara Boxer, Orrin Hatch, Charles Grassley, and Don Nickles, and Massachusetts governor Bill Weld, were filmed in a scene that was entirely improvised. 

===Pre-production===
The project was obtained from Fox by Initial Entertainment Group, and was sold to USA Films by IEG for North American rights only. Stephen Soderbergh never approached USA Films, and the film was fully funded by Initial Entertainment Group.
 Spanish while talking to each other.    This meant that almost all of Benicio del Toros dialogue would be subtitled. Once the studio realized this, they suggested that his scenes be shot in both English and Spanish, but Soderbergh and Del Toro rejected the suggestion.  Del Toro, a native of Puerto Rico, was worried that another actor would be brought in and re-record his dialogue in English after he had worked hard to master Mexican inflections and improve his Spanish vocabulary. Del Toro remembers, "Can you imagine? You do the whole movie, bust your butt to get it as realistic as possible, and someone dubs your voice? I said, No way. Over my dead body. Steven was like, Dont worry. Its not gonna happen."  The director fought for subtitles for the Mexico scenes, arguing that if the characters did not speak Spanish, the film would have no integrity and would not convincingly portray what he described as the "impenetrability of another culture". 
 The Battle All the Presidents Men because of its ability to tackle serious issues while being entertaining.    In the opening credits of his film, Soderbergh tried to replicate the typeface from All the Presidents Men and the placement on-screen at the bottom left-hand corner. Analyzing this film helped the director deal with the large cast and working in many different locations for Traffic. 

===Principal photography===
Half of the first days footage came out overexposed and unusable.  Before the financiers or studio bosses knew about the problem, Soderbergh was already doing reshoots. The insurers made him agree that any further lensing mishaps resulting in additional shooting would come out of the directors own pocket.  Soderbergh shot in various cities in California, Ohio and Texas, on a 54-day schedule and came in $2 million under budget.  The director operated the camera himself in an effort to "get as close to the movie as I can," and to eliminate the distance between the actors and himself.  Soderbergh drew inspiration from the cinema verite style of Ken Loachs films, studying the framing of scenes, the distance of the camera to the actors, lens length, and the tightness of eyelines depending on the position of a character. Soderbergh remembers, "I noticed that theres a space thats inviolate, that if you get within something, you cross the edge into a more theatrical aesthetic as opposed to a documentary aesthetic".  Most of the day was spent shooting because a lot of the film was shot with available light. 
 Panavision Millennium XLs that were smaller and lighter than previous cameras and allowed him to move freely.  In order to tell the three stories apart, he adopted a distinctive look for each. For Robert Wakefields story, Soderbergh used tungsten film with no filter for a cold, monochrome blue feel.  For Helena Ayalas story, Soderbergh used diffusion filters, flashing the film, overexposing it for a warmer feel. For Javier Rodriguezs story, the director used tobacco filters and a 45-degree shutter angle whenever possible to produce a strobe-like sharp feel.  Then, he took the entire film through an Ektachrome step, which increased the contrast and grain significantly.  He wanted to have different looks for each story because the audience had to keep track of many characters and absorb a lot of information and he did not want them to have to figure out which story they were watching. 

Benicio del Toro had significant input into certain parts of the film; for example, he suggested a simpler, more concise way of depicting his character kidnapping Francisco Flores that Soderbergh ended up using.  The director cut a scene in which Robert Wakefield smokes crack after finding it in his daughters bedroom. After rehearsing said scene with the actors, he felt that the character would not do it; after consulting with Gaghan, the screenwriter agreed and the filmmakers cut the scene a brief time before it was scheduled to be shot. 

===Post-production=== MPAA gave it an R. 

==Release==

===Box office performance=== USD $184,725 on its opening weekend. It was given a wide release on January 5, 2001 in 1,510 theaters where it grossed $15.5 million on its opening weekend. The film would make $124.1 million in North America and $83.4 million in foreign markets for a worldwide total of $207.5 million, well above its estimated $48 million budget.   

===Critical response=== average score of 8/10,  with Del Toro receiving widespread acclaim, and the consensus being "Soderbergh successfully pulls off the highly ambitious Traffic, a movie with three different stories and a very large cast. The issues of ethics are gray rather than black-and-white, with no clear-cut good guys. Terrific acting all around." At Metacritic the film has received an average score of 86, based on 34 reviews.  Film critic Roger Ebert gave the film four out of four stars and wrote, "The movie is powerful precisely because it doesnt preach. It is so restrained that at one moment&mdash;the judges final speech&mdash;I wanted one more sentence, making a point, but the movie lets us supply that thought for ourselves".  Stephen Holden, in his review for The New York Times, wrote, "Traffic is an utterly gripping, edge-of-your-seat thriller. Or rather it is several interwoven thrillers, each with its own tense rhythm and explosive payoff".  In his review for The New York Observer, Andrew Sarris wrote, "Traffic marks   definitively as an enormous talent, one who never lets us guess what hes going to do next. The promise of Sex, Lies, and Videotape has been fulfilled". 

Entertainment Weekly gave the film an "A" rating and praised Benicio del Toros performance, which critic Owen Gleiberman called, "haunting in his understatement,   becomes the films quietly awakening moral center".  Desson Howe, in his review for the Washington Post, wrote, "Soderbergh and screenwriter Stephen Gaghan, who based this on a British television miniseries of the same name, have created an often exhilarating, soup-to-nuts exposé of the worlds most lucrative trade".  In his review for Rolling Stone, Peter Travers wrote, "The hand-held camerawork &ndash; Soderbergh himself did the holding&mdash;provides a documentary feel that rivets attention".  However, Richard Schickel, in his review for Time (magazine)|Time, wrote, "there is a possibly predictable downside to this multiplicity of story lines: they keep interrupting one another. Just as you get interested in one, Stephen Gaghans script, inspired by a British mini-series, jerks you away to another".
